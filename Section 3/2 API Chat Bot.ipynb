    "# Creating a chat bot\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will be using the OpenAI python API to create a chat bot. The chat bot has a very specific purpose, to teach the user how to train a machine learning model in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialised chat bots have a _\"system prompt\"_. The system prompt tells the LLM how it should behave. Your system prompts are your intellectual property. They are kept secret from the end user. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good system prompt could have taken you a very long time to iteratively develop. If somebody has access to your system prompt, then they can clone your chat bot. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of this lesson is an introduction to prompt hacking and defenses against prompt hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The list of messages\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the ChatCompletions API endpoint in previous lessons, we have been passing a list called `messages`.\n",
    "So far, the list has only contained one element - a dictionary with two keys, `\"role\"` and `\"content\"`. We have been using the `\"user\"` role so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses gpt-3.5-turbo for _multi-turn_ conversations. In a _single-turn_ text completion, we send a single message and receive a reply. In a _multi-turn_ conversation, our `messages` list will grow with every message that we send and receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three _roles_ that a message can take. The roles can be `\"system\"`, `\"user\"` or `\"assistant\"`. The `\"system\"` role is the system prompt. The `\"user\"` role  is for messages from the user. And the `\"assistant\"` role is for messages that the LLM replies to us. We append the full history of messages to the `messages` list and send it with each API query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI API rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "The replies from our _chat bot teacher_ will be pretty long. We will be sending the replies back to the model. Because it needs the context of what it has previously written to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you send several requests in a minute, then the API will throw a RateLimitError. (See documentation: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6897202-ratelimiterror) \n",
    "If that happens, just wait one minute and try again. In the next notebook, we will use the backoff python package to automatically backoff API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this workbook should still cost you less than $1 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the documentation of the OpenAI error codes for your reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors\n",
